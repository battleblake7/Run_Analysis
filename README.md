# Run_Analysis
#First I had to read all of the various tables from the dataset group, specifically for each of the column names. 

#Then I had to combine the columns that were needed from train and test, using the rbind function for X, Y, and subject. Then combine them all and called that merged data. 

#Then I needed to select the subject and code that contains what we were looking for, which is the mean and standard deviation. 

#I had to get the names of all of the selections to replace the names with the new names. 

#Then create a finaldata txt file to share with the group. 

# so by the end,

I Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
